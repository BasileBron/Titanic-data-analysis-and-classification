This repository is my submission for the **kaggle competition** : "*Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster*"

The goal was to predict the survival of 1300 passagers only by using the remaining 800.

## Details and accuracy result

I used a very basic model as a test which gave an overall result of 87%.
You can easily change it, but don't forget to specify the input size.

## Statistics

This submission was a good introduction to the **pyplot** library and the R language. Here are some of the charts that you can find in this repository :
